## Introduction


This project was done under the supervision of [Dr. John Cook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-cook-343a23/) and [SUNLAB](http://sunlab.eecs.uottawa.ca/people/group-members/). 

## Motivation

 The main purpose was to prepare equipment to study a novel technology cluster particularly effective in northern conditions. It proposes to place two demonstrator research stations at different latitudes in northern communities.
 
## Installation

Each station would contain monofacial and bifacial photovoltaic (PV) panels, two-dimensional solar trackers, conventional inverters and microinverters, battery management systems, weather instrumentation, solar irradiation spectrometers, and Intelligent Distribution Panels (IDP).
